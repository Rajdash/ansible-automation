Ansible playbook to setup VPC, Subnets, Security group in AWS. Also launch ec2 instances and add public ips into hosts.ini

Requirement:
- ansible launch machine with RHEL or Centos
- Python
( Note: python-pip and boto3 will be installed by playbook ) 

Running entire playbook will create vpc,subnet,security group along with ec2 instances. 
# playbook to run:
## ansible_ec2_provisioning.yml: 
```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini ansible_ec2_provisioning.yml -e@ec2-key.yml --ask-vault-pass

```
AWS access key can be stored into yml secured with 'ansible-valut' e.g. use following command:

ansible-valut create ec2-key.yml

### ec2-key.yml example
```YAML
---

ec2_access_key: "_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_"
ec2_secret_key: "_AWS_SECRET_KEY_"

```

Default variables can be overloaded using runtime variables and can be passed in separate yml 
### Passing dymanic variable though config_update.yml
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini ansible_ec2_provisioning.yml -e@config_update.yml -e@ec2-key.yml --ask-vault-pass

```

### Dynamic host inventory

It is good practive to use dymanic inventory instead of static, this can also be achived with following -

Create source/environment file "env_vars" with following contents. use command 'source env_vars' to export environment variables.

### env_vars file example:
```shell
## AWS access key and secret key with default region as optional varaible
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="_AWS_SECRET_KEY_"
export region="us-east-1"

## use ec2.py and ec2.ini from given path
export ANSIBLE_HOSTS="inventory/ec2.py"
export EC2_INI_PATH="inventory/ec2.ini"

```

ec2.py will fetch dymanic host list from AWS to local cache ( manged by variables in ec2.ini ) by using configurations from ec2.ini. 
Note that by default public dns name would be used as host variable however this can be changed to private specially in case on VPC

### variables in ec2.ini file example:
```shell
destination_variable = private_ip_address

vpc_destination_variable = private_ip_address

```

### Using dymanic inventory

Now that dynamic inventory is fetched, here is how we can use this. To test if dymanic inventory works, try following.

### test and Fetch aws inventory :
```shell

python inventory/ec2.py --list

```

ec2.py can be used to fetch dymanic inventory, by setting up ANSIBLE_HOSTS we pointed playbook to fetch dynamic inventory by default. 
Alternatively we can pass this inventory file using -i option.

### Playbook on dymanic inventory with host and group variables

AWS tags are used to group the instances. host_tag varaible can be overriden from default to change tags of the intances which is added by playbook at the time of instance creation.

### 
```shell
host_tag:
   name: webserver
   source: ansible

```
With tag key 'name' and value 'webserver' as above host variable 'tag_name_webserver' can directly be used in playbooks further to execute over all instances with name=webserver tag. 

### use tag variable as host directly inside playbooks 
```shell
---
- hosts: tag_name_webserver

```

### Use tag variable as host directly replacement for host
```shell
$ ansible -m ping tag_name_webserver
10.1.2.193 | success >> {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}

10.1.2.136 | success >> {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}

10.1.2.137 | success >> {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}

```

for host and group vars file with name 'tag_name_webserver' can be used under host_var or group_var directories to fetch respected variables.

Further any provising configurations playbooks can executed over this dymanic inventory to configure the host according to needs. 

Limitations:
 - need to use existing ssh key for ec2, no playbook to create key.
 
## setup_ssh.yml:
This playbook can be used to setup password less ssh on each of the hosts/instances listed in inventory file. We will need to pass initial private key and the user which is used to provision the VM. Ansible playbook will use 'ansible' user to run the playbooks. 
```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini setup_ssh.yml --private-key=Key001.pem -u ec2-user

```
